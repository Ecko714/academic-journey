                    <p class="classOpinion">Alright. Time to get into the "nitty-gritty". This class went over high level assembly. Remember
                        that item that was highlighted in red on a couple pages back with the word "Stack" on it? We are revisting that term 
                        in this class. That is because the stack data structure is an integral structure to any classical computer. Using the stack
                        along with other technologies like interrupts, the CPU/ALU, and I/O, we learned how to write instructions for a CPU to use.
                        Fascinating material with a good professor, one of the better courses that I've taken!

                    <p class="classOpinion">Another great course. This class gave me my first taste of C programming which was immensely helpful for
                        other classes to come. Not only did it give me experience with programming in C, the course gave an overview of all
                        different types of programming from procedural (C) to logic (prolog) programming. This was also one of the first courses that
                        gave me a healthy challenge. My first programming course, CSE 110, wasn't too bad since I had prior programming experience and 
                        I already knew the basics. However, this course "pulled back the curtain" for me on programming and showed me more of what 
                        I was capable of. It was difficult but in a good way!

                                    in a "step-wise function". Key features of this paradigm include: modularized code 
                                    (also known as functions, <strong>procedures</strong>, modules, or subroutines), local and 
                                    global variables, data <em>structures</em>, and flow control statements like conditional and 
                                    loop statements.

                                    to bundle their code into <strong>"objects"</strong> that can be used throughout their program. This paradigm also comes with
                                    two other important features: Inheritance and Polymorphism. Inheritance is essentially a way to create new objects 
                                    with new attributes from existing ones without rewriting code and Polymorphism allows for context-based use of 
                                    objects.

                                it can get very confusing for me personally (parentheses... so many parentheses...). Very mathematical in nature!

                    <p class="classOpinion">Geology was more of a "let's get this over with" class for me, I'll be totally honest. 
                        I generally love learning, so it wasn't so bad, but it took up a lot of my time. The class had a couple of lectures
                        every week and a lengthy textbook assignment coupled with a quiz. A lot of the work was more tedious than anything. 
                        We covered everything from minerals in the ground beneath us to understanding the surface of Mars.

                        the start to understanding the relationship between humans and technology, which I think sounds so cool to learn about. 
                        Nope, it was essentially a psychology 101 course. I give the course the benefit of the doubt since it is an introductory
                        course and they couldn't jump into technical jargon without laying a foundation but, if I recall correctly, there were no 
                        lessons on application in tech. Regardless, we took the time to learn how the human brain works. Things like perception,
                        consciousness, and personality were discussed. As was the case with geology, I enjoy learning so the class was still fascinating. 
                        I just wish there was a more technical application.
