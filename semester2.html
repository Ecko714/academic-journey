                        <p>"This course will cover the nature of atoms and elemental substances, the combination of atoms to form
                            molecules and compounds, the interactions between atoms and molecules, chemical bonding models,
                            relationships between chemical and physical properties, thermochemistry, and solutions. More importantly, you
                            will have the opportunity to practice your critical thinking skills and learn how the macroscopic world around
                            you can be explained by the microscopic world underneath."

                        <p>Ok! Another CS course. This one was good, I liked this one. Here, students learned 
                            the basics of data structures which are essentially different ways to store data in any application.

                    <p class="classOpinion">And here starts the downfall of my steady academic career! Oh boy. This was the first time
                        I've run into actual calculus. I've heard about it (obviously pre-calculus implied what was coming) but I've never 
                        taken the time to look into what the math was for. I knew that Algebra focused on variables and Geometry on shapes
                        but what in the world was <em>calculus</em> for? <br><br>Well, as the description says, differerential calculus is used to 
                        study how functions change with respect to a single variable. You learn how to find the limit of a function, it's derivative, and 
                        eventually you get a taste on how to find it's integral. I thought I was good at math but for some reason, calculus 
                        never made total sense to me. That is until later... we'll get to that. Combine an older professor with a heavy accent, a sloppy
                        blackboard full of chalk, and the beginning of the coronavirus and you get a recipe for a <em>failing</em> grade.
                        <br><br>ANYWAY, here's some random homework about finding limits (I know it's kinda hard to see, my bad).

                    <p class="classOpinion">One of the first classes that I can call my favorite! This was such a joy to take. 
                        This course dived deep into the history of Latinx culture in the United States. We started with understanding the 
                        sub-cultures of Hispanics, Latinos, Chicanos, and Boricuas and ended with Latinx politics. Growing up as a Hispanic, 
                        the only time I was ever able to celebrate my culture was when I was with family. I didn't have many other friends that 
                        shared my culture so being able to take this class to really dive deeper into what it means to be Hispanic was very
                        fulfilling. We wrote essays, had discussions, and watched movies to have conversations about different histories.
