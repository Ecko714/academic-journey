                    <p class="classOpinion">CSE 301 is a necessary course for all computer science majors and for good reason. This class
                        highlighted the importance of understanding that, as an engineer, you are responsible for any systems that you create
                        that the public will use. In the same breath, discussing the importance of respecting the profession and being generally
                        respectful. If you're work seems dangerous or you see work being done that could be dangerous, speak up even if that means you
                        could lose your job. The class mainly consisted of texbook readings with comprehension quizzes and a few papers to write. The papers
                        were more personal rather than research-based.

                    <p class="classOpinion">CSE 360 was a great class for me. The course had a couple of weekly lectures that went over
                        the process of creating software. The class was broken into groups of four-to-five students and a main project was given out 
                        which was the bulk of the course. Students were tasked with creating an application with Java. <br><br>Our group decided to create an 
                        application that serves as a restaurant's ordering platform. We had monthly project updates as well as weekly group meeting updates. 
                        Basically a "what did you do this week" update. This class was fun for me because I just love programming and creating a product. It 
                        was also very engaging, having to interact with a group all the time which I am assuming is what the industry will be like.

                    <p class="classOpinion">Information Assurance is similar to cybersecurity. Where cybersecurity focuses on networks and devices, 
                        information assurance focuses on data. This was a greast class that was incredibly challenging for me personally. Concepts were
                        complex and assignments took some time if you had little to no experience in Python (like me). The course went over topics like
                        types of security protocols, cryptography, network/web/system security, and legal and ethical issues. The course used a capture the
                        flag (CTF) framework for assignments which is a common learning style, I hear, for this sort of material. My professor for this class
                        was Adam Doupé. He was amazing. Very knowledgeable and has plenty of experience so he was quite the help for the course.

                    <p class="classOpinion">MAT 243 introduced me to a ton of important computer science ideas. Discrete math went over proofs,
                        functions, algorithms and their complexities, and integer representation which are all important ideas. Most of the material 
                        was confusing for me mainly because the material was so theoretical. Later I will realize why but, at the moment, it was 
                        next to useless for me.

                    <p class="classOpinion">I needed just one more class to keep my scholarships for the semester so I ended up with this class. 
                        I mainly took it because it was the only one that seemed interesting to me in the massive list of classes I could take. It 
                        was interesting but tedious like the geology course last semester. Homework every few days that corresponded with lengthy lectures
                        and readings from a book. I will say that I learned a lot though. Living in Arizona for my entire life but not knowing much except
                        for the major Phoenix area is not something I am proud of.
