                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p><em>How we doinnnn?</em> My name is <strong>Gabriel</strong>, pleasure to meet ya! I am currently a student at ASU studying 
                    Computer Science. I am pretty close to finishing my degree. I graduate, ~hopefully~, next Winter and I cannot be more excited.
                    I've got a solid group of people helping me through this chapter in my life: Pictured on the left is one of my favorite people, 
                    best friend, sista from anotha mista, <strong>Skyler</strong>. I've known her since my junior year of high school and a little fun 
                    fact: We just recently hit a five-year streak on Snapchat which I think is actually really cool. I also live with my family currently 
                    and they are also major supporters in my life which I am grateful for. In my free time, you could find me either with friends, playing
                    video games (My brother and I have been playing this franchise, Destiny, for almost ten years!), or scrolling for hours on TikTok (don't lie, 
                    you do it too). 
                </p>

                    <h3>Plans For The Future</h3>
                    <p>Whenever I am with family, or really talking to anyone who is interested in my education, a lot of the time the 
                        conversation culminates into the same question: "So. What do you want to do with your degree?". Usually people have 
                        a hard time answering this question but I've had to explain it so many times that I think I've got it down well. Here's 
                        what I say <em>everytime</em>: My goal, as a programmer, coder, developer, [insert X computer-science-y sounding job title], is 
                        to work in a really cool office, with a lively team, and work on projects all day. It sounds so vague and non-compelling but for 
                        me, it's the kind of work that I really like. Whenever I get the chance to sit down, put my headphones on, and just code for 
                        hours on end, I really am having the best time. At the moment, I'm not getting paid for it... eventually, I will.

                    <h3>What Are We Doing Here?</h3>
                    <p>This section isn't meant to throw you into an existential crisis, sorry about that. I just wanted to give a quick
                        introduction into the rest of the website and give insight on the creation. As a First Generation student, I don't
                        exactly have a role-model to look upon for guidance on what I should be doing or 
                        how I should be doing things. Thus, I have resorted to the internet to guide me in the right direction. However, 
                        I found that a lot of resources never gave a look into <em><strong>what</strong></em> I would actually be learning.
                        Most anecdotal resources, as well as official, often gave a title and a small description of what classes were; which is not
                        very helpful when you are starting your computer science education with a very limited background. So, here I am, with a complete 
                        breakdown of my computer science degree so far! I will be discussing terms and concepts that I've learned so far so be ready for 
                        some technical jargon. You can use the tabs on the left side to view any semesters of mine you are interested in!
