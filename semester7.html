                    <p class="classOpinion">Uh Oh. Time to start the <strong><em>trifecta</em></strong>. The trifecta is what students
                        call the "weeder" classes. Anecdotally, they exist to see if students are willing to put in the time to show that 
                        they are capable enough to call themselves "computer scientists". <br><br>CSE 340 was my introduction to things like 
                        language analysis and program functionality. We start with lexical analysis and move our way upward towards
                        type checking and creating our own compiler. We dip our toes into lambda calculus but we didn't have any assignments 
                        on it or anything, just on the final. The class was interesting at best and exhuasting at worst.

                    <p class="classOpinion">Another piece of the <strong><em>trifecta</em></strong>! Thankfully, this one I enjoyed. 
                        However, it was still incredibly difficult for me. The material was absolutely tricky and convoluted near the end 
                        of the semester. We start with a bit of the same material from CSE 340: understanding how languages work. We then 
                        move into automata which are computational models consisting of states, transitions, and transition functions. After
                        that we dive deeper into theory relating to decidability and thus, undecidability. Essentially understanding the scope 
                        of problems that classical computers can solve. <br><br>This was also another class where I had a great professor. 
                        Professor Lee was incredibly engaging and wanted his students to succeed at grasping this sort of material. Again, 
                        although incredibly difficult, it was still a great class for me.

                    <p class="classOpinion">CSE 463 have students understand how to find a problem, brainstorm ideas, and find a solution 
                        all while keeping several factors in mind including, but not limited to: human capability, design laws, and public 
                        needs. I enjoyed this class because of how involved it was. The lecture component wasn't my favorite but my instructor 
                        seemed knowledgeable so it wasn't so bad. But myself and the group that I was paired with actually went through the entire
                        design process for an application. We performed analyses on our idea and createed prototypes and even tested our prototypes 
                        on a small group of individuals. <br><br> Pictured is the digital prototype of our system that we created.
