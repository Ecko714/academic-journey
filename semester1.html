                    <p class="classOpinion">Ahh, you never forget your first class... ASU 101 was a mandatory class for every freshman. 
                    We learned the basics of being a student at ASU: communicating with just about everyone (faculty, advisors, even
                    our peers). We discussed important things like understanding syllabi, creating your own schedules,
                    and navigating social interactions (I think a lot of students need a refresher on this one #ThanksCovid #AllTeaAllShade).
                    Not much to say about this class.

                    <p class="classOpinion">Alright, an actual class. ASU starts Computer Science majors off with 
                        Java (I want to say there is also a python or C++ class that you can start with but this class
                        was on my major map so I'm stickin' with it). You learn fundamental concepts like primitive data types, 
                        variables and functions, as well as other Java-specific tools like classes. The class is built for students who have
                        ZERO programming knowledge which I think is really cool. There are things that I've learned in this class that I still
                        utilize to this day! 10/10 would take again. <br><br> (P.S. Professor Yoshi was the best)

                    <p class="classOpinion">There is a reason I am pursuing a STEM degree. Oh my goodness, this class was a DRAG.
                        I will say, the professor that I had for this class was one of the better professors that I've interacted with. He 
                        was very compassionate and was ready to listen to anything you had to say which I appreciate considering the classroom
                        is a space for learning and understanding. I once had a passion for writing but that fire was smothered <em>long</em> ago.
                        Creative pieces and analytic pieces were written in this course. 0/10 would take again.

                    <p class="classOpinion">Back to the fun stuff! FSE 100! What an interesting class. Here, the class learned how to 
                        tackle engineering questions, what it means to be an engineer, and most importantly, how to work in a collaborative
                        environment. The main project was a Lego&copy; robot set that was programmable. We used MATLAB as our IDE which was 
                        a first for me. I was always used to Visual Studio Code or Atom as my IDE (for the uninitiated, an IDE is an <strong>I</strong>ntegrated
                        <strong>D</strong>evelopment <strong>E</strong>nvironment! It's software that makes writing code ~so~ much easier). Very enjoyable class
                        and I was lucky enough to have a great professor for this class as well. <br><em>Shout out Professor Osburn! (I end up 
                        having him for two other classes!)</em>

                        been interested in. As this was a beginner class, the material was easy to digest and wasn't very overbearing. Assignment-wise we had 
                        4 exams, about a quiz every other week, and a few discussion posts that had a light amount of research go into them. Interesting class, not

                    <p class="classOpinion">Ohhhhhh boy. And here we begin my mathematics journey. Not excited. Pre-Calculus. In hindsight, the class was not hard.
                        It was your average math class: come to class, learn about a topic, you have a couple of days to finish homework for that topic before you go
                        back to learn about a new thing. It moved at a steady pace from learning about different functions to exploring different ideas like
                        trigonometry with everyone's favorite: the unit circle. Technically, I should've taken this in high school but that's neither here nor there.
