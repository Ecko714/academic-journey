                    <p class="classOpinion">ALA 100 had students understand the importance of desigining a product with many factors 
                        at play. Social, technical, and environmental factors can influence how you design a product. The class was online
                        and had weekly video lectures that were accompanied by small quizzes. The bulk of the course came in the form of 
                        one major project that was split into phases. I can't remember the specifics, but I do know that we essentially had
                        to document our process of finding what generally makes a good chair and then go on to create our own. It was an okay
                        class. Not my favorite.

                        and I was struggling immensely. 0/10 would take again.

                    <p class="classOpinion">WE'RE BACK! More computer science material. This class gave students a look at the low level workings
                        of classical computers. "Combinational logic circuitry" is a fancy phrase for combining logic gates to create a circuit
                        that will handle bit operations. I learned things like how to manually work with binary and other bases like hexadecimal, 
                        understand structures like multiplexers and registers, and what finite state machines are. Looking back, it was a pretty involved
                        course for a 100 level course but it was still very interesting. I enjoyed it.

                    <p class="classOpinion">More Logic! Content-wise, incredible material. It was mainly theoretical but it helped to 
                        fortify my knowledge of truth tables, truth statements, and working with boolean logic. This class is the computer
                        science side of discrete mathematics. We started with propositional logic which involved taking declarative sentences, 
                        breaking them down into symbols, adding connectives, and then creating a formula to create the same proposition. Once you 
                        have the formula, you can manipulate it to create different propositions. After understanding this, we moved into first-order 
                        logic and then into logic <em>programming</em>. We used Prolog to do our programming.

                        for computer science majors so I have no choice but to retake this class. Long story short: I failed again and I had to request
                        a third time repeat which wasn't fun but if I want to graduate with this degree, I <em>have</em> to get past this class. And trust
