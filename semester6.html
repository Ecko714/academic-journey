                    <p class="classOpinion">CSE 310! We are now entering the more difficult CS courses. We're not quite yet in the 
                        <em>trifecta</em> but still very difficult. CSE 310 was not so much about programming but more about understanding 
                        different types of problems. One of the topics that stayed relevant throughout the course was of course the "Asymptotic
                        Notation" of an algorithm or "Big-O" of an algorithm. You can find out more about that from the embedded YouTube video!
                        I also learned about multiple other sorting algorithms, Graph Theory, important algorithms like Dijkstra's (please 
                        enjoy my instructor's meme about this algo) and Prim's Algorithms, and how to handle dynamic 
                        programming. I thought it was a pretty intense class.

                    <p class="classOpinion">CSE 335 was another one of my favorite courses. The class was an iOS development course
                        so we used Swift and XCode as our tools for development. App development was one of the first things that 
                        piqued my interest in computers. I remember watching a video when I was younger on some guy creating a 
                        deck of cards application and being so fascinated by the entire process. In this course, we had bi-weekly assignments
                        and a final project. <br><br>My project idea was a to-do list that went by the name of "Habitz". It had two APIs that 
                        gave you an inspiring quote when you open the app and the weather which, depending on the temperature, changed the 
                        background color of the app! It also used a database so that way different users could use the program and have 
                        their own set of tasks. I was very proud of what I made because I worked so hard on it.

                    <p class="classOpinion">Pretty sure this is your typical, run of the mill economics course. This was only an 
                        elective for me. My professor was nice but that's about it. There's really nothing I have to say about this one!
                        Topics range from supply and demand to cost of living to money growth and inflation.

                    <p class="classOpinion">Back to calculus! Now, no surprise here but I fail this course. JUST ONE TIME THOUGH! I am labeling
                        it as a favorite course, however, only because of the professor. Professor Inozemtseva has been one of, if not my favorite, 
                        professors. She has an actual, genuine interest in mathematics and it shows. She cares for her students and loves to interact. 
                        She also does something that I rarely see instructors do which is to show applications of the material that we are learning. 
                        There wasn't a unit that went by that didn't have an accompanying real-world result. It was a great class with her and I am 
                        thankful that I was able to get her in the next semester for an A-session retake!
